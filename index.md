## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education (IPIU)](https://ipiu.xidian.edu.cn/), [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. [Fang Liu](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/LF8/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Licheng Jiao](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/JLC/zh_CN/index.htm). 

## Research Interests 

My current research lies in Multi-Modality Understanding and Video Analysis. My research areas involve:

- **Video Analysis:** Video Anomaly Detection, Action Recognition, Video Captioning     
- **Visual-Language Analysis:** Multimedia Event Extraction, Grounded Situation Recognition   
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement Learning in Visual-Language Community
- **Zero-Shot Inference:** Zero-Shot Image Captioning, Zero-Shot Video Captioning
